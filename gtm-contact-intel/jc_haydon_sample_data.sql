Saw your recent post about pipeline accuracy - the 60 responses show this is hitting a nerve for a lot of folks.

Saw your recent post about pipeline accuracy - the 60 responses show this is hitting a nerve for a lot of folks.

We''ve worked with several VP of Saless at similar companies who were wrestling with the same issue. One example: [similar company] cut their [metric] by 40% after making a few changes to how they approached this.

Would you be open to a quick 15-minute call to share what worked for them? No pitch, just happy to share what we''ve learned.

Would you be open to a quick 15-minute call to share what worked for them? No pitch, just happy to share what we''ve learned.

Saw your recent post about pipeline accuracy - the 60 responses show this is hitting a nerve for a lot of folks.

We''ve worked with several VP of Saless at similar companies who were wrestling with the same issue. One example: [similar company] cut their [metric] by 40% after making a few changes to how they approached this.

Would you be open to a quick 15-minute call to share what worked for them? No pitch, just happy to share what we''ve learned.

Saw your recent post about pipeline accuracy - the 60 responses show this is hitting a nerve for a lot of folks.

We''ve worked with several VP of Saless at similar companies who were wrestling with the same issue. One example: [similar company] cut their [metric] by 40% after making a few changes to how they approached this.

Would you be open to a quick 15-minute call to share what worked for them? No pitch, just happy to share what we''ve learned.

Saw your recent post about pipeline accuracy - the 60 responses show this is hitting a nerve for a lot of folks.

We''ve worked with several VP of Saless at similar companies who were wrestling with the same issue. One example: [similar company] cut their [metric] by 40% after making a few changes to how they approached this.

Would you be open to a quick 15-minute call to share what worked for them? No pitch, just happy to share what we''ve learned.

Saw your recent post about pipeline accuracy - the 60 responses show this is hitting a nerve for a lot of folks.

We''ve worked with several VP of Saless at similar companies who were wrestling with the same issue. One example: [similar company] cut their [metric] by 40% after making a few changes to how they approached this.

Would you be open to a quick 15-minute call to share what worked for them? No pitch, just happy to share what we''ve learned.

Saw your recent post about pipeline accuracy - the 60 responses show this is hitting a nerve for a lot of folks.

We''ve worked with several VP of Saless at similar companies who were wrestling with the same issue. One example: [similar company] cut their [metric] by 40% after making a few changes to how they approached this.

Would you be open to a quick 15-minute call to share what worked for them? No pitch, just happy to share what we''ve learned.

Saw your recent post about pipeline accuracy - the 60 responses show this is hitting a nerve for a lot of folks.

We''ve worked with several VP of Saless at similar companies who were wrestling with the same issue. One example: [similar company] cut their [metric] by 40% after making a few changes to how they approached this.

Would you be open to a quick 15-minute call to share what worked for them? No pitch, just happy to share what we''ve learned.

Saw your recent post about pipeline accuracy - the 60 responses show this is hitting a nerve for a lot of folks.

We''ve worked with several VP of Saless at similar companies who were wrestling with the same issue. One example: [similar company] cut their [metric] by 40% after making a few changes to how they approached this.

Would you be open to a quick 15-minute call to share what worked for them? No pitch, just happy to share what we''ve learned.

Saw your recent post about pipeline accuracy - the 60 responses show this is hitting a nerve for a lot of folks.

We''ve worked with several VP of Saless at similar companies who were wrestling with the same issue. One example: [similar company] cut their [metric] by 40% after making a few changes to how they approached this.

Would you be open to a quick 15-minute call to share what worked for them? No pitch, just happy to share what we''ve learned.
